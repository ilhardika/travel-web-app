a minimalist and modern UI for the Travel Booking Web App. The design should feature:
- Clean layout with a focus on user experience and intuitive navigation.
- High-quality visuals with a modern color palette (soft gradients, whites, and dark tones).
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile views.
- Clear call-to-action buttons (e.g., 'Add to Cart', 'Checkout', 'Book Now').
- Consistent typography and icons that align with the travel and adventure theme.
- Include interactive elements like hover effects, smooth transitions, and micro-interactions for user engagement.
- Optional: Incorporate search/filter options, ratings, or user reviews if relevant to the page.
- Show the layout as a wireframe or high-fidelity mockup.
